So the meadows are green for your children's children.

The mission of DripDrop is to reduce water usage and promote conservation in California to ensure a sustainable future for the next generation. Features of this application include a water usage calculator, latest drought news and alerts, several interactive water-related educational games, and a customized user profile page with a personalized water usage goal as well as any "badges" the user may have earned. Users are also able to create a secure account (with password hashing) to save their information for the next time they log in.
